Financial institutions need to measure risks within their credit portfolios for regulatory requirements and for internal risk management. To meet these requirements financial institutions increasingly rely on models and algorithms to predict losses resulting from customers' defaults. Hence, developing sufficiently accurate and robust models is one of the major efforts of quantitative risk management groups within these institutions.

The proposed research is one such effort to develop robust and efficient models for the credit default risk problem. Specifically, we study the mathematical foundation of some Machine Learning classification algorithms and develop them to predict default risk for credit card accounts.
